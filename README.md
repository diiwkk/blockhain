Custom ERC-20 Token
Introduction
Welcome to the Custom ERC-20 Token repository! This project serves as a demonstration of an ERC-20 token implemented in Solidity, specifically designed for deployment on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard establishes a set of regulations and capabilities that streamline interaction between various decentralized applications (DApps) and Ethereum wallets.

Key Attributes
ERC-20 Token Features: This project incorporates fundamental ERC-20 token functionalities, ensuring compatibility with a diverse array of Ethereum-based applications.
Initial Token Supply: Upon deployment, an initial supply of 2000 tokens is predefined. Furthermore, customization options are available for tailoring the token's name and symbol to align with specific project requirements.
Transaction Data Retrieval Functions: Discover additional functionalities provided by the project, such as retrieving the latest transaction's block timestamp in a human-readable format, accessing the sender's address associated with a transaction, and identifying the receiver's address involved in the transaction.
